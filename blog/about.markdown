I am Yaron Sheffer. This is my (rather rarely updated) blog, focusing mainly
on security and mostly covering my work at the [IETF](www.ietf.org).

My slightly obscured email address is at the bottom of each page, feel free
to drop me a note.

Physically, I am most likely to be in [Tel Aviv, Israel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VX9Az81nkcLP9wZr9). But I enjoy traveling and do it often.
