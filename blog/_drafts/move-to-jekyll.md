I have been blogging very irregularly for several years. In 2019 I found out
about svbtle.com and liked it a lot: it supports Markdown, it's very simple and
lightweight, and costs very little and comes with a "forever promise".

Forever, though, did not last. It is late 2024, I posted a short blog and found
out that Chrome marks Svbtle as "unsafe". This happened to me (on my corporate
laptop, which just might have something to do with it) and to one other person
who was kind enough to inform me.

I wouldn't mind that much but svbtle.com is clearly stale. In fact that was
somewhat apparent even when I joined... But it's very clear now. And so if
something bad happens and the site is blocklisted, I cannot be sure
that there's a human that cares enough to deal with the situation.

Unfortunately blogging has become esoteric enough that there are few if any
well known platforms that are likely to stay viable for the foreseeable
future. Luckily more technical people have the alternative of self-hosting
a blog. (You don't need to be a Web/JavaScript wizard, which I'm clearly not,
but you need basic Linux and Web background; otherwise, I guess Medium is
your friend).
